BCCTools are set of performance/tracing tools that are build on top of BCC.
They live in the same repo as bcc, and usually are packed together/next to BCC.

Hence for installation see [bcc](./bcc.md)

- handy [github link](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master#tools) are part of BCC toolkit

List of commands I do have man page for:
- [tcpconnect](../../COMMANDS/TCPCONNECT/index.md)
