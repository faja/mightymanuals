When we `rebase` we have to provide commit hash from which we want to start
history manipulation. It must be "AT LEAST" one more then we want to manipulate.

For instance to squash last two commits we have to go for `HEAD~2` which is
3rd commit back (`HEAD=1st`, `HEAD~1=2nd`, `HEAD~2=3rd`)

```bash
###############################################################################
# squash last two commits together
git rebase -i HEAD~2
# commit at the top is the OLDER commit (HEAD~1), set `pick` on it
# commit at the bottom is the NEWER commit (HEAD), set `squash` on it
# edit commit message, save, exit
```
