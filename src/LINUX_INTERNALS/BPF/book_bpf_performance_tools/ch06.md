This chapter is CPU performance analysis related. Both BPF and classic approach.

Some questions that can be answered:
- What new processes are created? What is their lifespan?
- Why is system time high? Are syscalls the culprit? What are they doing?
- How long do threads spend on-CPU for each wakeup?
- How long do threads spend waiting on the run queues?
- What is the maximum length of the run queues?
- Are the run queues balanced across the CPUs?
- Why are threads voluntarily leaving the CPU? For how long?
- What soft and hard IRQs are consuming CPUs?
- How often are CPUs idle when work is available on other run queues?
- What is the LLC hit ratio, by application request?
