`htop` (originaly `top`) - prints CPU and other statistics

NOTE:
Unfortunately, many `top` variants focus on visual enhancements
rather than performance metrics, making them prettier but unable to shed
lighton issues beyond the original `top`.

Some handy key shortcuts:
```sh
t          # tree view

H          # toggle user threads
K          # toggle kernel threads

\          # filter (hide not matching)
/          # search and jump to finding

u          # show processes of a single user
.          # sort by ...

?          # show help obviously:)
```
