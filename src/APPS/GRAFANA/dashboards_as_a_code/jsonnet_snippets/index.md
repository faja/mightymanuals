panels (as local variables)

IMPORTANT NOTES: some panels are supported by grafonnet, some are not, even a
panel is supported sometimes it misses a functionality, hence I found it MUCH
more nice to just go for pure jsons but with cutted of all the default values.
With such approach json is pretty small, and it is easy to change etc...
