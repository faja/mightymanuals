# tips & trix

### OMG! re-indent magic with `=`
- to reindend a selection, simply select few lines and press `=`
- to magically reindend the whole file: `gg=G`
    - `gg` - go to the top
    - `=`  - reindent
    - `G`  - go to the bottom


### reverse order of lines
    - entire file
    ```
    :g/^/m0
    ```
    - visual selection:
    ```
    :'<,'>g/^/m${FIRST_LINE_NUMBER-1}`
    ```
    where FIRST_LINE_NUMBER, is the first line number of the selection,
    eg, if we wanna revers lines from 10 to 15: `g/^/m9`

<c-w>T - move current window to new tab

:set            - shows vars different from defaults
:set all        - shows all values
:set foo?       - shows the value of foo
:set foo+=opt   - add opt to the value w/o changing others
:set foo-=opt   - remove opt from value
:set foo&       - reset foo to default value
:setlocal foo   - only the current buffers

# add patch
- go to status `:G`
- put cursor on a file, and hit `i`
- visual block/line you want to add, and use `-` to stage/unstage

# :Git blame
- `g?` - for help
- `-`  - reblame at the commit          - this basically means - rerender the file at this particular commit
- `P`  - reblame at the previous commit - this measn - show me how the file looked like before this one was added

# navigate through the Gclog
- open a file
- :Gclog -- %    - this is pretty cool, it will show you all the commits related to this file
- select a commit you want to interact with
- navigate to the changed file with `]m`
- then you can press `o`(- split), `gO` (| split), or `O` (new tab) to open
    - a diff
    - how the file looked liek BEFORE the change
    - how the file looks liek AFTER the change

# :Gedit
- `:Gedit HASH:file` - opens a file at a specifc commit
- `:Gedit HASH:%` - opens current file ata specific commit

this is equivalent of
  git diff 5618c3e5bf62847c1b9f7420783ec27dd438244e..b386ffca433ed6a49b76147758857d1a4f84caba vpc/outputs.tf
