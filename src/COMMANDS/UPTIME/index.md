`uptime` is one of several commands that print the system load averages

```sh
$ uptime
00:34:10 up 6:29, 1 user, load average: 20.29, 18.90, 18.70
```

By comparing these numbers, you can determine whether the load has been increasing,
decreasing, or steady during the past 15 minutes or so.

```sh
uptime -s   # pretty neat, boot time!
```
