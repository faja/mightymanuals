`tcpaccept` - **BPF** based tool, that shows **"passive"** TCP connections - the one
               caused by `accept()` syscall - aka **incoming** connections

(see also: [tcptracer](../TCPTRACER/index.md) and [tcpconnect](../TCPCONNECT/index.md))


<span style="color:#ff4d94">**NOTE:**</span> I didn't find the tool after
installing `libbpf-tools` under debian


```sh
tcpaccept  # default
# todo more usage todo
```
